The Data files consist of the record of 4 sectors(A-D), 4 Subsectors, 4 Streets, 4 Houses and two floors

Due to my slow system writing all the record was taking a significant amount of time. There is a option in the program to make the 
data files automatically with the input number of sectors subsectors streets and houses. One can write the data of any amout of 
sectors, subsectors, streets ,houses and floors.It will be created automatically.

Thankyou!
